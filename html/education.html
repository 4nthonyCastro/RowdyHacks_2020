	<h3>Health Information:</h3>
	<p>Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) </p>
	<p>Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus. </p>
    <br>
	<p>The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell. </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "column">
	<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
	<p>People may be sick with the virus for 1 to 14 days before developing symptoms. The most common symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.</p>
	<p>More rarely, the disease can be serious and even fatal. Older people, and people with other medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), may be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill. </p>
	<p>People may Experience:</p>
	<p> - Cough </p>
	<p> - Fever </p>
	<p> - Tiredness </p>
	<p> - Difficulty Breating (severe cases) </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "colum">
	<h3>Prevention:</h3>

	<p>You can protect yourself and help prevent spreading the virus to others if you: </p>
	<p> - Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub </p>
	<p> - Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze </p>
